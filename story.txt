Once upon a time, Bob the monkey lived on a berry tree near the river. 
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile named James with his wife Sarah.
One day James came to the bank of the river and rested under a tree.
Kind hearted Bob offered James some delicious berries and they became friends.
James started visting Bob daily.
Bob wanted to make clothes for himself using crocodile skin.
He slowly started to be defriendly to James by feeding him with poisonous berries.
